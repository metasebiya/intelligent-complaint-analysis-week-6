## 🔍 Credit Scoring Business Understanding


Before diving into technical implementation, let’s define key financial concepts relevant to the fintech domain:

---

### 💳 Financial Terms

* **Credit**: The provision of loans or financing through technology-driven platforms.
* **Credit Scoring**: Assigning a quantitative score to estimate a borrower's likelihood of default.
* **Credit Risk**: The potential financial loss if a borrower fails to meet their obligations.

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project applies data science techniques and machine learning algorithms to solve [problem statement]. It follows a full ML pipeline from data ingestion to model deployment.

Key objectives:

- Explore and clean the dataset.
- Engineer relevant features.
- Train and evaluate multiple ML models.
- Deploy the final model as a REST API.
